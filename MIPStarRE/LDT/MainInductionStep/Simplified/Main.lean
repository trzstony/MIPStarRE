# Main induction theorem of the simplified low-degree proof

The public ordinary-strategy statement has no pasting attempt count.
Its degree-zero error is `δ + √(8mε)` and its positive-degree error is
`1000d²m⁴(ε^(1/32)+δ^(1/32)+(d/q)^(1/32)+γ^(1/8))`.
The answer-valued strong induction supplies the proof while keeping
the ordinary strategy's state and point measurement unchanged.

/-- `thm:main-induction` in the simplified blueprint. A good projective
symmetric strategy has a complete polynomial measurement consistent with
its point measurement at the displayed degree-dependent error.

The public statement keeps the original strategy and polynomial
measurement types and removes only the proof artifact `k` and its
exponential term. The direct degree-zero estimate is the separate
boundary case stated in the simplified blueprint. -/
