# Section 5 — Rounding To Projectors Core

Internal lemmas for the orthogonalization and rounding-to-projectors chain.

This file extracts the consistency-to-almost-projective and spectral/rounding
steps so that `QXPLayer.lean` can depend on them without importing the full
Section 5 theorem file.

The consistency defect of `(A,B)` controls the strong self-consistency defect
of the left-placed version of `A`. The Cauchy–Schwarz chain and tensor
hermitian identities have been factored out above, so the main proof is now a
straightforward combination of those helpers.
