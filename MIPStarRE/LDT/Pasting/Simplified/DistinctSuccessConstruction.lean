# Pasting from distinct successful slice outcomes

The simplified pasting construction uses a completed sequential measurement
for every tuple of uniformly sampled slice questions. An outcome contributes
when it contains `d + 1` successful outcomes at distinct slice heights. The
selected slices determine a global polynomial; all other outcomes are ignored.
