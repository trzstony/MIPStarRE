Formalization project for mathematics around $\mathrm{MIP}^*=\mathrm{RE}$.

## Active paper track

The current active proof-following track is:

- arXiv:2009.12982, *Quantum soundness of the classical low individual degree test* (LDT).

The in-repo paper source mirror lives at `references/ldt-paper/`.  The
formalized proof follows the simplified proof in
`blueprint/src/low_degree_simplified.tex`, which proves the main theorem with
the error `21000 K_{m,d} (ε^(1/64) + (d/q)^(1/64))` and no sampling parameter.
The paper's statement with the sampling parameter `k` is derived from it as
`MIPStarRE.LDT.Test.mainFormalWithK`.

## Source-of-truth order (LDT)

When working on the active track, consult these locations in this order:

1. **`references/ldt-paper/`** — in-repo TeX source mirror for the paper. This is the ground truth for the definitions and the original theorem statements.
2. **`blueprint/src/low_degree_simplified.tex`** — the simplified proof that the formalization follows.
3. **`blueprint/src/chapter/`** — active, dependency-tracked LaTeX blueprint with Lean cross-references (`\lean{}`, `\leanok`).
4. **`MIPStarRE/`** — Lean development that matches the blueprint. Declarations in `MIPStarRE.LDT.*` are cross-referenced from the blueprint.

Supporting notes:

- `audits/2026-03-20_ldt-source-map.md` — source-file / theorem-ownership map
- `audits/2026-03-20_ldt-blueprint-dependency-review.md` — dated dependency-review snapshot (context, not canonical)

The blueprint is organized by **theorem ownership and proof dependency**, not by raw TeX input order.

## Repository layout

```

├── Quantum/               # Reusable matrix / measurement infrastructure
│   ├── FiniteHilbert.lean

└── LDT/                   # Low individual degree test (12 submodules)
    ├── Basic/             # Parameters, operators, distributions, submeasurements

```

Each LDT submodule typically contains `Defs.lean` and `Theorems.lean` (larger
submodules split these across subdirectories). The root module `MIPStarRE.lean`
re-exports `MIPStarRE.Quantum` and `MIPStarRE.LDT`.

Top-level directories:

- `MIPStarRE/` — Lean source (see above)
- `blueprint/src/` — active LDT blueprint (chapters under `blueprint/src/chapter/`)
- `references/ldt-paper/` — in-repo TeX source for the LDT paper
- `docs/` — contributor guides, style, naming, proof integrity, CI notes
- `audits/` — dated chapter-by-chapter dependency-scouting reports

## Proof dependency order

The blueprint chapters follow the proof dependency order:

1. Chapters 2–3: test setup and preliminaries
2. Chapter 4: making measurements projective (linear orthogonalization)
3. Chapters 5–6: expansion and global variance
4. Chapter 7: self-improvement with simultaneous dilation
5. Chapter 8: commutativity
6. Chapter 9: pasting
7. Chapter 10: main induction and the proof of the main theorem

## Build

**Toolchain**: See `lean-toolchain` and `lakefile.toml` for the pinned Lean and Mathlib versions.

From the repo root:

```bash
# First-time setup: fetch the Mathlib cache, then build
lake exe cache get
lake build

# Type-check a single file (fastest iteration loop)
lake env lean MIPStarRE/LDT/SelfImprovement/Defs.lean

# Check declarations referenced from the blueprint
lake exe checkdecls blueprint/lean_decls
```

Blueprint commands (from the repo root, with `leanblueprint` on your `PATH`):

```bash
leanblueprint pdf    # PDF output
leanblueprint web    # HTML output
```

## Contributing

Start with [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for PR/issue conventions and the review checklist. Key references:

Shared Mathlib-style conventions (style, naming, documentation, PR review,
proof integrity, prose) live in the `lean-conventions` skill of
[texra-ai/texra-lean-skills](https://github.com/texra-ai/texra-lean-skills),
auto-installed for Claude Code via `.claude/settings.json` (other agents:
clone the repository and symlink the skill directories into the agent's
skill location, as described in its README).

MIPStarRE-local references:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` | PR format, issue templates, label taxonomy, review checklist |
| `docs/project_conventions.md` | MIPStarRE-local addenda to the shared conventions (linter warnings, source-faithfulness review, proof integrity) |
| `docs/mathematical_language.md` | Project-local mathematical language rules for Lean names and documentation |
| `docs/blueprint_style_guide.md` | Blueprint notation and section conventions |
| `docs/ci-automation.md` | CI/CD workflow details |
| `audits/` | Chapter-by-chapter Mathlib dependency scouting reports |

When adding or completing a declaration, update the corresponding blueprint entry in `blueprint/src/chapter/`: add `\lean{DeclName}` and `\leanok` for new results, or `\leanok` on `\begin{proof}` for newly proven results.
