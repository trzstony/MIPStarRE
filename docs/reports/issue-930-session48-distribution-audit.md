# Issue #930 session 48 distribution discrepancy audit

Audit date: 2026-05-01

Base commit: `68e3a1d9` (`origin/main` when this worktree was created)

Branch: `gpt55/session48-930-distribution-audit`

## Executive summary

I audited the distribution and average infrastructure used by the LDT formalization:

- `MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/Distribution.lean`;
- directly related average and distribution constructors in `MIPStarRE/LDT/Test/Defs.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Test/StrategyCore.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Test/StrategyFailures.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Test/StrategyRoleAverage.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Preliminaries/Defs.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Pasting/Defs/Tuples.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Pasting/Core.lean`, `MIPStarRE/LDT/Pasting/BridgeLemmas/Common.lean`, and `MIPStarRE/LDT/Pasting/BridgeLemmas/LineInterpolation/Averaging.lean`.

I compared these files with the paper's distribution conventions in:

- `references/ldt-paper/preliminaries.tex:253-286` and `337-368`, where the paper defines consistency and state-dependent distance using a distribution on the question set;
- `references/ldt-paper/test_definition.tex:21-57`, where the three LDT subtests and their uniform choices are defined;
- `references/ldt-paper/ld-pasting.tex:167-213`, where the distinct-tuple distribution and its total-variation comparison are used;
- blueprint nodes `def:simeq`, `def:approx_delta`, `def:good-strategy`, `def:low-individual-degree-test`, and `def:distinct-tuples` in `blueprint/src/chapter/ch02_test.tex`, `ch03_preliminaries.tex`, and `ch09_pasting.tex`.

Scope check before the audit: the only open PR was draft #889, the Lean/Mathlib upgrade, and it does not touch the audited distribution files.  The open zhengfeng/deng work is #931 on self-improvement inputs and #888 on blueprint warning annotations; neither overlaps this distribution slice.  At the time of the original audit, issue #997 had introduced optional PMF/measure adapters; those adapters have since been removed because no downstream Lean module imported them.

Verdict: I found one already-formalized paper boundary repair.  The paper writes the distinct-tuple distribution as a uniform probability distribution for every `k >= 1`, but that support is empty when `k > q`.  Lean extends this object to a finite nonnegative weight for all `k`, proves it is a probability distribution under `k <= q`, and treats the `k > q` total-variation bound as a trivial large-error case.  I documented this in a paper-gap note on the distinct-tuple support (since removed together with the original pasting construction, which the simplified proof replaces by independent tuples).  No Lean theorem statement or proof needs to change.

Apart from that boundary issue, I found no hidden change to constants or hypotheses.  The ordinary paper-facing test distributions remain genuine uniform probabilities.  The optional PMF and finite-measure adapters mentioned in the historical audit snapshot are no longer part of the live Lean tree.

## Finding 1: project-local distributions are finite weights, with a separate probability predicate

The paper's informal notation uses a distribution `D` on a question set and writes expectations such as `E_{x ~ D}`.  Lean's foundational `Distribution` structure is deliberately more general: it stores an explicit finite support, a nonnegative real weight, and a proof that weights vanish outside support (`Distribution.lean:16-22`).  Normalization is not part of the structure.  It is instead the predicate `Distribution.IsProbability`, with the bundled subtype `ProbabilityDistribution` for code that needs a genuine probability (`Distribution.lean:25-37`).

This is a conservative formal repair rather than a change in paper-facing content.  The averaging operator `avgOver` is the finite weighted sum over the explicit support (`Distribution.lean:96-99`), and probability-specific facts such as averaging a constant are stated only under `IsProbability` or for the bundled subtype (`Distribution.lean:249-382`).  Uniform distributions on nonempty finite types are proved to be probabilities (`uniformDistribution_isProbability`, `Distribution.lean:386-402`).

The generic relations `ConsRel`, `SDDRel`, `SSCRel`, and `BipartiteSSCRel` take a `Distribution` rather than a `ProbabilityDistribution` (`Test/Defs.lean:201-265`).  That makes internal finite-weight estimates available without repeatedly packaging normalization.  The paper-facing uses audited here instantiate them with `uniformDistribution` on nonempty finite types or with the distinct-tuple finite weight discussed below.

## Finding 2: the LDT test averages match the paper's uniform choices

The paper's verifier chooses each of the three subtests with probability `1/3`, and within the line tests chooses the point, direction index, role, and restricted direction uniformly (`test_definition.tex:21-57`).  Lean's symmetric-strategy failure surrogates match these choices:

- `SymStrat.axisParallelFailureProbability` is a uniform average over `AxisParallelTestSample params = Point params × Fin params.m` (`StrategyCore.lean:298-305`, `StrategyFailures.lean:18-29`).
- `SymStrat.selfConsistencyFailureProbability` is a uniform average over `Point params` using the bipartite strong self-consistency defect (`StrategyFailures.lean:30-40`).
- `SymStrat.diagonalFailureProbability` averages uniformly over `j : Fin params.m` by the scalar factor `1 / params.m`, and then uniformly over `RestrictedDiagonalSample params j` (`StrategyCore.lean:321-332`, `StrategyFailures.lean:42-58`).
- The full two-role strategy uses the same branch weights as the paper: the two axis-parallel role choices are averaged by `/ 2`, the two diagonal role choices are averaged by `/ 2`, and the final low-individual-degree failure probability averages the three branches by `/ 3` (`StrategyFailures.lean:247-308`).

All denominators are guarded by the parameter assumptions already present in `Parameters`: `0 < params.m`, `0 < params.q`, and the prime-power field witness.  I found no altered branch weight or missing nonemptiness hypothesis in these uniform test distributions.

## Finding 3: the former PMF and measure adapters were unused

The merged #997 changes left the foundational distribution API PMF-free and measure-theory-free.  It also introduced optional adapter modules `DistributionMeasure.lean` and `DistributionPMF.lean`.  A later reachability check showed that no downstream LDT module imported either adapter: `DistributionPMF.lean` was unimported, and `DistributionMeasure.lean` was imported only by `DistributionPMF.lean`.

Those optional adapters have therefore been removed as unused Mathlib bridge infrastructure.  The live distribution API remains the project-local finite-support structure in `Distribution.lean`, together with the finite-sum `avgOver` and `averageOperatorOverDistribution` definitions used by the paper formalization.

## Finding 4: the distinct-tuple distribution is the only paper boundary repair

The paper defines `Distinct_k` and writes a uniformly random element of this set for every `k >= 1` (`ld-pasting.tex:167-179`).  This requires `k <= q`.  No such hypothesis appears in the paper statement or in the final pasting theorem's assumptions.

Lean repairs this by defining `distinctTupleDistribution params k` as a finite-support weight for every `k` (`Pasting/Defs/Tuples.lean:23-36`).  The general theorem only proves total mass at most `1` (`Pasting/Defs/Tuples.lean:38-67`).  The exact probability statement is separated as `distinctTupleDistribution_weight_sum_eq_one_of_le`, which assumes `k <= params.q` (`Pasting/BridgeLemmas/Common.lean:311-343`).

The formal `ldDnoteq` comparison handles both cases.  If `k <= q`, it follows the paper's collision-probability argument.  If `k > q`, the distinct support is empty; the formal total variation between the uniform tuple distribution and the zero distinct-tuple weight is `1/2`, and this is bounded by `k^2/q` because `k > q` (`Pasting/Core.lean:561-805`).  The averaging helper `avgOver_distinct_bounded_le_avgOver_uniform_add_tv_of_any_k` propagates the same convention to bounded nonnegative functions (`Pasting/BridgeLemmas/LineInterpolation/Averaging.lean:286-318`).

This is harmless for the formal argument: when `k > q`, the error term `k^2/q` is already at least `1`, so the comparison is a trivial bound rather than a meaningful coupling of two probability distributions.  The new paper-gap note records this boundary convention explicitly.

## Finding 5: average operators and relation-level expectations keep the same constants

Scalar and operator averages both use the same finite support and weights.  `averageOperatorOverDistribution` is the operator-valued analogue of `avgOver` (`Distribution.lean:100-109`) and unfolds to the ambient finite sum because weights vanish outside support (`Distribution.lean:259-271`).  This is used for averaged point operators such as `averagePointOperator` and `averagePointMeasurement` in `Test/StrategyPolynomialFamilies.lean:144-163`, matching the paper's notation `A = E_u A^u`.

The standard algebra of expectations is implemented without changing constants: `avgOver_add`, `avgOver_const_mul`, `avgOver_mul_const`, `avgOver_sum`, `avgOver_comm`, `avgOver_uniform_prod`, `avgOver_uniform_comm`, and the product marginal lemmas in `Distribution.lean:160-578` are ordinary finite-sum identities.  The downstream commutativity full-slice averages use these uniform product identities to match the paper's independent uniform choices; I did not find a hidden normalization loss or extra constant in the audited average infrastructure.

## Follow-up

I did not open a separate follow-up GitHub issue.  The only concrete discrepancy is now documented in a paper-gap note on the distinct-tuple support (since removed together with the original pasting construction, which the simplified proof replaces by independent tuples); the formal code already contains the needed repaired interpretation and no Lean or blueprint change is required in this PR.

## Validation

Validation was run after adding this report and the paper-gap note:

A scratch `#check`/`#print axioms` file was also run at the audited snapshot.  The then-existing adapter declarations `Distribution.toPMF` and `Distribution.toMeasure` have since been retired as unused.  The current distribution route continues to use the audited finite-sum declarations such as `uniformDistribution_isProbability`, `avgOver_uniform_prod`, `distinctTupleDistribution_weight_sum_le_one`, `distinctTupleDistribution_weight_sum_eq_one_of_le`, `ldDnoteq`, and `avgOver_distinct_bounded_le_avgOver_uniform_add_tv_of_any_k`.
