# External Lemmas — Pedagogy and Mathlib Mapping

A register of mathematical facts used in the Lean formalization whose proof
is **not** explained in the LDT paper sources (`references/ldt-paper/`).  For
each entry, we give the paper location, the Mathlib (or external) declaration
that supplies the fact, and a brief pedagogical explanation.

This document is intended for:

- **New contributors** who need to understand where a proof step "comes from"
  when the paper doesn't elaborate it,
- **Paper-gap auditors** checking whether a Mathlib-dependent step faithfully
  reproduces the paper's reasoning,
- **Upstreaming scouts** looking for candidates to contribute back to Mathlib
  (tracked in issue [#1250]).

## 1. Cauchy–Schwarz for approximate measurements

**Paper reference**: Section 3 (Preliminaries), Propositions
`prop:easy-approx-from-approx-delta`, `prop:closeness-of-ip`,
`prop:cab-approx-delta`.

**Lean file**: `MIPStarRE/LDT/Preliminaries/CauchySchwarz.lean`

**What the paper assumes**: The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for inner products
in a Hilbert space, plus standard manipulation of absolute values and sums.

**Mathlib source**: The proofs use only elementary real analysis
(`Real.sqrt`, `Real.sum_sqrt_mul_sqrt_le`, `Finset.abs_sum_le_sum_abs`)
plus project-local expectation lemmas (`ev_adjoint_self_nonneg`,
`ev_abs_mul_le_sqrt`).  No external "Cauchy–Schwarz theorem" import is
needed because the form used is a direct consequence of the
*sum-of-sqrt-products* inequality, which Mathlib provides in
`Mathlib/Data/Real/Sqrt.lean`.  The project uses the `ℝ` version of
`Real.sum_sqrt_mul_sqrt_le`, with pointwise nonnegativity hypotheses; the
same file also contains the corresponding `NNReal` statement.

**Pedagogical note**: The key insight is that
`|∑ a, ψ(X_a Y_a)| ≤ (∑ a, ψ(X_a X_a†))^(1/2) · (∑ a, ψ(Y_a† Y_a))^(1/2)`
follows from the standard Cauchy–Schwarz inequality applied to the
inner product `⟨u, v⟩ = ∑ a, ψ(u_a v_a†)` on operators.  The proof in
`CauchySchwarz.lean` breaks this into three standard inequalities:
triangle inequality for sums, pointwise `|ψ(X_a Y_a)| ≤ sqrt(ψ(X_a X_a†)) *
sqrt(ψ(Y_a† Y_a))`, and the sum-of-sqrt-products inequality
`Real.sum_sqrt_mul_sqrt_le`.

**Upstream potential**: Low — this is a specialized application of
general inequalities to the project's `ev` / `QuantumState` types.
Not a candidate for Mathlib.

## 2. Schwartz–Zippel for multivariate polynomials

**Paper reference**: Section 3 (Preliminaries), Proposition
`prop:schwartz-zippel`.

**Lean file**: `MIPStarRE/LDT/Preliminaries/Polynomials.lean`

**What the paper assumes**: If `P` is a non-zero polynomial over `F_q` in
`m` variables with individual degree at most `d` in each variable, then
`Pr_{x ∈ F_q^m}[P(x) = 0] ≤ m·d / q`.

**Mathlib source**: `Mathlib.Algebra.MvPolynomial.SchwartzZippel`

The Mathlib lemma `MvPolynomial.schwartz_zippel_totalDegree` gives exactly this bound
for polynomials over any integral domain, with zero-probability measured
as a cardinality ratio over the full product space.  The project wraps it:

```lean
abbrev polyFunc (m : ℕ) (K : Type*) [CommSemiring K] (d : ℕ) :
    Submodule K (MvPolynomial (Fin m) K) :=
  MvPolynomial.restrictDegree (Fin m) K d
```

Then the Schwartz–Zippel bound follows from
`MvPolynomial.schwartz_zippel_totalDegree`.

**Pedagogical note**: Schwartz–Zippel is a standard result in theoretical
computer science.  The Mathlib proof follows the classical induction on
variables: factor `P` as a polynomial in `x_1` with coefficients in
`F_q[x_2, ..., x_m]`, apply the univariate bound (a degree-`d` polynomial
over a field has at most `d` roots) to the leading coefficient, and
union-bound over variables.

**Upstream potential**: None — Mathlib already has the lemma.

## 3. Fourier orthogonality over finite fields

**Paper reference**: Section 3 (Preliminaries), Propositions
`prop:fourier-fact-scalar` and `prop:fourier-fact-vector`.

**Lean file**: `MIPStarRE/LDT/Preliminaries/FiniteFields.lean`

**What the paper assumes**: For a finite field `F_q = GF(p^t)` with
additive character `ω = exp(2πi·tr(_) / p)`, we have
`E_{x ∈ F_q} ω(tr[x·a]) = 1` if `a = 0`, `0` otherwise.

**Mathlib source**:
- `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LegendreSymbol.AddCharacter` — additive characters
  over finite abelian groups
- `Mathlib.Analysis.Fourier.FiniteAbelian.Orthogonality` — orthogonality of
  additive characters over finite groups
- `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Complex.CircleAddChar` — the primitive
  additive character `x ↦ exp(2πi·x/p)` on `ZMod p`

The key Mathlib lemma is `AddChar.expect_eq_ite` (or similar in the
`AddChar` API), which gives the expectation of a nontrivial additive
character over the whole group as zero.

**Pedagogical note**: An additive character of a finite abelian group `G`
is a homomorphism `χ : G → ℂ×` with `|χ(g)| = 1`.  Characters are
orthogonal:
`E_{g∈G} χ(g) · ψ(g)⁻¹ = 1` if `χ = ψ`, `0` otherwise.
For the paper's setting, `G = F_q` (additive group of the field) and
`χ_a(x) = ω(tr[a·x])`.  The orthogonality follows because the trace
form `(a, x) ↦ tr[a·x]` is a nondegenerate bilinear form, so
`a = 0` gives the trivial character (value always 1) and `a ≠ 0` gives
a nontrivial character (orthogonal to the trivial one).

**Upstream potential**: None — Mathlib already has the full theory.

## 4. Finite-field trace identity

**Paper reference**: Section 3 (Preliminaries), Definition
`def:finite-field-trace`.

**Lean file**: `MIPStarRE/LDT/Preliminaries/FiniteFields.lean`

**What the paper assumes**: The trace `tr : F_q → F_p` is
`tr(x) = ∑_{ℓ=0}^{t-1} x^{p^ℓ}` where `q = p^t`.

**Mathlib source**: `Algebra.trace` from field theory (`Algebra/Trace`).

The Mathlib lemma `FiniteField.algebraMap_trace_eq_sum_pow` confirms
that the algebraic trace over `ZMod p ⊆ F_q` agrees with the Frobenius
sum formula.

**Pedagogical note**: The trace of a finite field extension `F_q / F_p`
is the sum of the Galois conjugates:
`Tr_{F_q/F_p}(x) = x + x^p + x^{p^2} + ... + x^{p^(t-1)}`.
This is a linear map `F_q → F_p`.  Mathlib defines it via the general
`Algebra.trace` for finite extensions, and `FiniteField` provides the
explicit Frobenius-sum formula.

**Upstream potential**: None — Mathlib already has the lemma.

---

## 5. Eigenvalue bounds and spectral theory

**Paper reference**: Section 4 (Making measurements projective),
Lemmas `lem:projective-non-measurement` etc.

**Lean files**:
- `MIPStarRE/Quantum/FiniteMatrix.lean`
- `MIPStarRE/Quantum/FiniteHilbert.lean`
- `MIPStarRE/LDT/MakingMeasurementsProjective/`

**What the paper assumes**: Standard finite-dimensional spectral theory:
Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, PSD matrices have nonnegative
eigenvalues, `0 ≤ A ≤ 1` implies `A^2 ≤ A`, spectral truncation
(keeping only eigenvectors with eigenvalue ≥ ε), etc.

**Mathlib source**: `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.PosDef` for PSD
properties, `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Spectrum` for spectral
theorems for finite-dimensional operators.  The project uses Mathlib's
`Matrix.PosSemidef` typeclass and associated lemmas:
- `PosSemidef.mul_mul_conjTranspose_same` — PSD is stable under
  `A ↦ B†·A·B`
- `sq_le_self` (project-local) — `0 ≤ X ≤ 1` ⇒ `X² ≤ X`

**Pedagogical note**: The finite-dimensional spectral theorem says every
Hermitian matrix `A` can be diagonalized by a unitary:
`A = U·Λ·U†` where `Λ` is a diagonal matrix of real eigenvalues.  For
PSD matrices, all eigenvalues are ≥ 0.  The inequality `X² ≤ X` when
`0 ≤ X ≤ 1` follows because `λ² ≤ λ` for each eigenvalue `λ ∈ [0,1]`.

**Upstream potential**: `sq_le_self` is a project-local lemma that uses
Mathlib's `PosSemidef` API but packages a specific proof for the `X ≤ 1`
case.  Slight upstream potential — it's a matrix analog of a standard
operator algebra fact, but the `0 ≤ X ≤ 1` proof is specialized to
finite-dimensional complex matrices.  Tracked at [#1250].

## 6. Matrix order and PSD operators

**Paper reference**: Throughout Sections 4–12.

**Lean files**:
- `MIPStarRE/Quantum/FiniteMatrix.lean` — `Op d`, `normalizedTrace`,
  `IsProj`, `sandwich_nonneg`, `sandwich_mono`
- `MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/SubMeasurementCore.lean` — `SubMeas`, `Measurement`,
  `ProjSubMeas`, `ProjMeas`
- `MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/TensorPlacement.lean` — left/right tensor lifts
- `MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/QuantumState.lean` — `opTensor_nonneg`

**What the paper assumes**: Standard matrix algebra facts about
positively semidefinite operators, matrix multiplication, trace
properties, tensor products, etc.

**Mathlib source**: `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix` provides the full
matrix algebra; `Matrix.le_iff` and `Matrix.nonneg_iff_posSemidef`
connect the order to PSD; `leftTensor`, `rightTensor`, and `opTensor`
provide the Kronecker product; `Matrix.trace` provides the trace.

Project-local lemmas used in this section, proved in the project:

- `sandwich_nonneg` / `sandwich_mono`
  (`MIPStarRE/Quantum/FiniteMatrix.lean:96,103`) — PSD preservation and
  monotonicity under `M·P·M` when `M` is Hermitian
- `leftTensor_nonneg` / `rightTensor_nonneg`
  (`MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/TensorPlacement.lean:119,129`) — PSD lifts through
  tensor product with identity
- `leftTensor_le_one` / `rightTensor_le_one`
  (`MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/TensorPlacement.lean:139,150`) — the identity bound
  lifts through tensor product with identity
- `opTensor_nonneg` (`MIPStarRE/LDT/Basic/QuantumState.lean:213`) — PSD is
  stable under Kronecker product

These are local wrappers around Mathlib's `Matrix.PosSemidef` API, especially
congruence preservation and Kronecker-product PSD facts; they are not Mathlib
exports with these project names.

**Pedagogical note**: The matrix order `A ≤ B` is defined as
`B - A` is PSD.  The sandwich lemma `M·P·M ≥ 0` follows because
`(M·P·M) = M·(P)·M†` (since `M` is Hermitian) and PSD is stable under
congruence.  Tensor product with identity preserves both PSD and the
`≤ 1` bound because the eigenvalues of `A ⊗ I` are just the eigenvalues
of `A`.

**Upstream potential**: The project-local lemmas listed above are already used as trusted building
blocks for PSD transport and tensor-product bounds in the codebase. If Mathlib
exposes matching statements under standard names, these can be replaced without
changing any mathematical content.

## 7. Continuous Functional Calculus for matrices

**Paper reference**: Section 4 (Making measurements projective), where
the `CFC.sqrt` of a PSD operator appears.

**Lean files**: `MIPStarRE/Quantum/FiniteMatrix.lean`,
`MIPStarRE/Quantum/FiniteHilbert.lean`

**What the paper assumes**: Applying a continuous function `f` to a
Hermitian matrix via spectral decomposition, specifically `√A` for
`A ≥ 0`.

**Mathlib source**: `Mathlib.Analysis.CStarAlgebra.ContinuousFunctionalCalculus`
provides the CFC.  For `Matrix ι ι ℂ`:

- `CFC.sqrt_nonneg` — `0 ≤ A` ⇒ `0 ≤ √A`
- `CFC.sqrt_one` — `√1 = 1`
- `CFC.sqrt_mul_sqrt_self` — needs explicit `0 ≤ A` hypothesis
- `cfc_nnreal_le_iff` — to prove `√A ≤ 1` when `A ≤ 1`, by comparing
  spectra via NNReal

**Pedagogical note**: The continuous functional calculus for a Hermitian
matrix `A = U·Λ·U†` applies `f` pointwise to eigenvalues:
`f(A) = U·f(Λ)·U†`.  For `f(x) = √x` on `[0,∞)`, this produces the PSD
square root.  Mathlib's `CFC` framework is fully general (for
C*-algebras), so for the finite-dimensional matrix case one uses
`cfc_nonneg_iff` and `cfc_nnreal_le_iff` to reduce to spectrum
comparisons.

**Known pitfall**: Direct `CFC.sqrt` on a term typed as
`MatrixOperator model.space` / `Quantum.Op model.space.carrier` can
hit a `NonUnitalContinuousFunctionalCalculus` typeclass heartbeat
timeout when `model.space` is a structure field.  The workaround
(document in project memory) is to define a helper over an explicit
carrier type and then instantiate with local `Fintype`/`DecidableEq`
instances.

**Upstream potential**: The CFC framework is already in Mathlib.  The
heartbeat timeout is a Mathlib performance issue, not a gap.

## 8. Chebyshev sum inequality

**Paper reference**: Used internally in `Preliminaries/Triangles/Core.lean`.

**Lean file**: `MIPStarRE/LDT/Preliminaries/Triangles/Core.lean`

**What the paper assumes**: Standard Chebyshev rearrangement / sum
inequality for monotone sequences.

**Mathlib source**: `Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Chebyshev`

The import is used for sum-rearrangement bounds that appear in the
triangle-inequality chain for measurement distance.

**Pedagogical note**: Chebyshev's sum inequality states that for two
similarly sorted sequences `(a_i)` and `(b_i)`,
`(1/n)·∑ a_i·b_i ≥ ((1/n)·∑ a_i)·((1/n)·∑ b_i)`.
The Mathlib lemma in `Algebra/Order/Chebyshev` provides this in
the `Finset` formulation.

**Upstream potential**: None — Mathlib has the lemma.

---

## 9. External result statements

The proof of `mainFormal` takes no external `*Statement` hypotheses.  The
former Polishchuk–Spielman soundness statement and the matrix Chernoff bound
belonged to the original proof route; the simplified proof uses neither.
